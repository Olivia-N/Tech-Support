            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>Renct is the one-stop-shop for the people looking to loan or rent out office equipment and space. With working from home becoming the new norm, offices have been missing employees to fill them. Instead of letting those unused monitors, ergonomic chairs and high-tech printers collect dust in the office, make money and help save the environment by renting them out to our verified users.
            </p>
            <p>
            To all the office workers sitting on uncomfortable kitchen chairs and squinting at spreadsheets on smaller screens for hours on end, Renct has a wide range of trusted companies who offer an even wider range of products for you to choose from. With just a few clicks, you can rent out an unused monitor to make life just that little bit easier during work from home.
